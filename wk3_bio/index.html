        <p>Hi! My name is Ellie Woodmoore. I served in the United States Navy from September 2018 to June 2022. I was an Information Systems Technician aka IT for short.
            My second duty station was on an aircraft carrier called the CVN 72 USS Abraham Lincoln in San Diego, CA. I like to say that I am well traveled as I have been to many states and countries. 
            I currently reside in Pawtucket, RI as I obtain my degree in Cybersecurity/Network Engineering here at NEIT.
            Also, I am hoping to gain two additional degrees (GMW & SE) at NEIT.  </p>
